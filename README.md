Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

This project is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. The project creates a database for this analysis. The database will be tested by running some queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

Project Overview
In this project is on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, there is a need to model data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. There are csv files in the local drive that would be trasnfered to the cassadra database, so an ETL pipelijne needs top be developed for that purpose
